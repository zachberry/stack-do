# stack-do

A simple little todo app written in Node and Angular. Adding a new item puts it in the list. Clicking on an item moves it to the top. Deleting the item puts it in the trash - clicking a trashed item restores it.

Currently a work in progress. Doesn't do any saving or persisting of data just yet.
